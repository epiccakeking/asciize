# Asciize Proportional

Attempt at an image to ascii converter (proportional version).

Spaces are replaced with nbsp, so technically it isn't a "pure" ascii image.

This program works best with high contrast images.

## Run

To convert the image at FILENAME with the font at FONT.TTF:

```
go run . FILENAME FONT.TTF
```
